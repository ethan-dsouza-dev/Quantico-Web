                <p>
                    UBC Quantico is a quantitative research club at The University of British Columbia. 
                    Quantico is a student-driven quantitative research club dedicated to building a community of analytical thinkers and problem-solvers. 
                    We provide a platform for members to collaborate on projects, share knowledge, and develop skills in areas such as machine learning, data science, financial modeling, and algorithmic trading. 
                    At Quantico, we believe in the power of numbers to unlock new possibilities.

                <h2>How We Came About</h2>
                <p>
                    When we noticed a lack of opportunities for students to apply quantitative methods in real-world scenarios, we set out to change that. 
                    Quantico was founded to bridge the gap between academic learning and practical application. 
                    By fostering an environment of mentorship, teamwork, and professional development, we equip our members with the tools to thrive in data-driven industries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Quantico welcomes students from all disciplines, united by their curiosity, integrity, and passion for solving complex problems. 
                    For many, the journey begins with a spark—their first exposure to the power of quantitative analysis. 
                    At Quantico, we nurture that spark, encouraging members to explore their interests and grow together in a collaborative community.
